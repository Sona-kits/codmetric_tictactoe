# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI

This is a GUI-based Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and Tkinter, where the computer uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.

## 📌 Task Overview

This project was completed as **Task 2** during my internship at **Codmetric**.  
The goal was to implement a smart Tic Tac Toe opponent using the **Minimax algorithm** with a clean interface and optimal move logic.

## 🧠 Features

- Human vs AI gameplay
- AI opponent uses the **Minimax** algorithm with recursion
- Built using **Tkinter** for a simple and intuitive GUI
- Displays real-time game status (win, lose, draw)
- "Restart Game" button to reset anytime

## 🖥 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Minimax algorithm (recursive implementation)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Save the code as `tictactoe_gui.py`
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python tictactoe_gui.py
